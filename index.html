            <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">I used to be a pack rat.</span> I had so many things that I thought
                that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. Things
                were terrible. I
                had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
            </p>
            <h3>How I
                turned things
                around</h3>
            <p> <span class="bold">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</span> I literally
                put 90% of my
                possessions in the
                garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. It wasn't easy at all, but
                everything
                around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
            <h3>Now I live the simple
                life</h3> Now that I'm
            living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have
            more free time
            to enjoy. With how much it turned my life around, <span class="bold">I felt like I had no choice but to
                start sharing how I
                did it</span>, and how
            others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
